- 👋 Hi, I’m Amber!
- 👀 I’m interested in the connections we can make between accessability and automation. I want to help change the narative around AI as our competitor, and focus on embracing the reality of productivity we can reach. The rapid progress fasinates me every day and I hope to one day work on the next mind blowing machine learning tool that will take the world by storm...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning working with a dataset of Waymo rides over a period of three months, with an end goal of discovering what the price surge looks like!
- 🧚🏼‍♀️ I just finished a project where I connected San Francisco's public crime record data with a route API, and modeled expected risk at a given coordinate for any route, providing you with reroutes if needed!
  Check that out in my Crime Repository!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects at the intersection of finance, sports analytics, and data science all around!
Whether it's working with geospacial data, web scraping, analyzing player performance / game statistics, or building predictive tools—I'd love to connect.
