- 👋 Hi, I’m @ammigonz
- 👀 I’m interested in the connections we can make between accessability and automation. I want to help change the narative around AI as our competitor, and focus on embracing the reality of productivity we can reach. The rapid progress fasinates me every day and I hope to one day work on the next mind blowing machine learning tool that will take the world by storm...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with big data using distributed computing with Apache Spark & streaming processing with Kafka.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects at the intersection of finance, sports analytics, and data science all around!
Whether it's modeling investment strategies, web scraping, analyzing player performance / game statistics, or building predictive tools—I'd love to connect.
- 📫 How to reach me: My linkedin profile is https://www.linkedin.com/in/amber-gonzalez-pacheco/
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love slacklining, yoga, and skateboarding! If I've been inside working all day, I'm itching to get outside for any of those activities!
